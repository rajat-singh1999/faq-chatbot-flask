## FAQ chatbots website using Flask deployment on AWS EC2

This project report presents the development and deployment
of a FAQ chatbots website using Flask and AWS EC2. The objective of the website
is to host multiple chatbots that provide accurate and relevant answers to user
queries based on predefined topics. The chatbots were developed using ConvAI, a
conversational AI framework. Flask, a Python web framework, was utilized to
create the website and handle user interactions. The website offers an
intuitive interface for users to input their questions and receive prompt
responses from the chatbots. Each chatbot is specialized in a specific topic,
ensuring accurate and reliable information delivery. AWS EC2 was chosen as the
deployment platform to ensure scalability, availability, and high performance.
Throughout the project, various stages were completed, including the design and
development of the chatbots using ConvAI, the creation of the website using
Flask, and the deployment of the website on AWS EC2. Testing and optimization
were performed to enhance the performance and user experience. The FAQ chatbots
website provides a user-friendly and efficient solution for accessing
topic-specific information. The utilization of Flask and AWS EC2 ensures the
website's reliability, scalability, and availability, making it suitable for a
wide range of users and applications.
